        "\n",
        "An **expert system** is a computer program that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. It is designed to solve complex problems and provide decision-making capabilities in a specific domain, typically by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if-then rules rather than through conventional procedural code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Main Components of an Expert System:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Knowledge Base:** This is the core component that stores all the domain-specific knowledge. It typically includes facts (information about the domain) and rules (IF-THEN statements that describe relationships and actions within the domain). The quality and completeness of the knowledge base are crucial for the expert system's performance.\n",
        "2.  **Inference Engine:** This component acts as the \"brain\" of the expert system. It processes the information in the knowledge base and the facts provided by the user to draw conclusions or make recommendations. It uses various reasoning strategies, such as forward chaining (data-driven) or backward chaining (goal-driven), to apply the rules.\n",
        "3.  **Working Memory (or Blackboard):** This is a dynamic database where facts about the current problem are stored during a consultation. It holds information provided by the user, intermediate conclusions drawn by the inference engine, and the final solution.\n",
        "4.  **User Interface:** This component facilitates interaction between the user and the expert system. It allows users to input information, ask questions, and receive explanations or solutions from the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of Expert Systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "Expert systems aim to:\n",
        "*   **Emulate human expertise:** Provide advice, diagnoses, or solutions comparable to that of a human expert.\n",
        "*   **Preserve knowledge:** Capture and store valuable domain knowledge from experts, preventing its loss.\n",
        "*   **Enhance decision-making:** Assist non-experts in making informed decisions in complex situations.\n",
        "*   **Improve consistency:** Ensure consistent application of rules and knowledge, reducing human error.\n",
        "*   **Reduce costs:** Potentially reduce the need for constant human expert consultation."

        "### Q&A\n",
        "The developed expert system is a rule-based system designed for troubleshooting common issues with a coffee machine. Its domain of application is simple coffee machine diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system implements 7 IF-THEN rules covering various problems such as power issues, water supply problems, and coffee taste variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its decision-making capabilities were demonstrated through five example interactions:\n",
        "*   When given facts \"coffee machine does not turn on\" and \"power cord is not plugged into the outlet\", the system recommended: \"Plug in the power cord.\"\n",
        "*   For \"coffee machine turns on but does not brew coffee\" and \"water tank is empty\", it concluded: \"Fill the water tank with fresh water.\"\n",
        "*   If \"coffee tastes weak or watery\", the system suggested: \"Try using finer ground coffee or adjust the grind setting on your grinder.\"\n",
        "*   Given \"coffee machine turns on but does not brew coffee\", \"water tank is full\", and \"no water flowing through the machine\", the system advised: \"Descale the coffee machine to clear potential clogs.\"\n",
        "*   When presented with \"coffee tastes burnt or bitter\" and \"machine has not been cleaned recently\", it concluded: \"Clean the brewing unit and drip tray thoroughly.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   An expert system was defined as a computer program emulating human decision-making, comprising a Knowledge Base (facts and IF-THEN rules), an Inference Engine, Working Memory, and a User Interface.\n",
        "*   The chosen domain for the expert system is \"Simple Coffee Machine Troubleshooting.\"\n",
        "*   A set of 7 distinct IF-THEN rules were defined to cover common coffee machine issues, such as power problems, water tank status, clogging, and coffee taste.\n",
        "*   A Python `RuleEngine` class was successfully implemented, capable of storing rules and inferring conclusions by checking if all conditions of a rule are met by a given set of facts.\n",
        "*   The expert system accurately applied the 7 defined rules across all 5 test scenarios, providing correct diagnostic conclusions for issues like an unplugged power cord, an empty water tank, weak coffee, clogs, and uncleaned components.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The implemented system successfully demonstrates the core principles of a rule-based expert system, providing a foundation for more complex diagnostic or recommendation engines.\n",
        "*   To enhance its utility, future development could focus on incorporating uncertainty handling (e.g., probability or fuzzy logic), enabling backward chaining for goal-driven reasoning, or building a more interactive user interface.\n"
